<p>Updating this for 2016!</p>
<p>The full list is up at <a href="https://amzn.com/w/BL961AA7J2RV">https://amzn.com/w/BL961AA7J2RV</a>. Pretty much everything I put up there.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s some notes / stuff that don&#39;t quite fit in with the list.</p>
<h2 id="essential-oils-diffuser">Essential Oils / Diffuser</h2>
<p>When we went to New Buffalo over summer, the house we stayed in had a diffuser and it smelled awesome.</p>
<p>Jenn got me a diffuser recently and some oils, but I was thinking another diffuser and some more oils
would be a good gift idea. Or maybe even one of those boxes they make for the oils to keep them together
and not jumbled in a drawer or something.</p>
<h2 id="disney">Disney</h2>
<p>Any ideas for essential Disney travel things in June are also good gift ideas, I think... part of the reason for
the water bottle on my list.</p>
<h2 id="drinks">Drinks</h2>
<p>One of the things I didn&#39;t see much on Amazon (or at least w/ reasonable price) was
nitrogen-infused coffee. I had one of these once, but can&#39;t remember where/when. Good stuff!</p>
<h2 id="pens">Pens</h2>
<p>There&#39;s multiple sets of pens on the list... primarily Japanese as the few that I&#39;ve worked with
(well... 2) work very nice and have a fine tip. For the most part, I probably only realy need 1 set...
and if you happen to know &#39;good&#39; pens, I&#39;m all for whatever anybody else can figure out.</p>
<h2 id="stuff-subscriptions">Stuff Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Repeat from last yr, but always a good idea...</p>
<p>In general, getting box(es) of random treats sounds cool.</p>
<p>Nothing in particular - although if there are options, Wasabe is not a favorite.</p>
<p><a href="http://beejuboxes.com/japanese-snack-boxes/">http://beejuboxes.com/japanese-snack-boxes/</a> has some reviews / links to places.</p>
