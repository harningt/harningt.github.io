<p>I have to say that even though it&#39;s <strong>technically</strong> inferior to the
more expensive and graphics-intensive XBox360 and Playstation 3... it
more than makes up for it in unique gameplay.  What other game system
integrates Bluetooth, accelerometers, pressure sensors, hardware-accelerated
crypto and Wifi into a unified experience that also brings legacy games to
the table?</p>
<p>The $40 Wiimote packs quite a bit into the little white shell.  It&#39;s packed
with an infrared camera, 3-direction accelerometers, Bluetooth connectivity,
and an extensible IO port to connect w/ a &quot;Nunchuck&quot; or &quot;Classic Controller&quot;.</p>
<p>The Wii Fit brings what is called the &quot;Balance Board&quot; as a fourth controller
to handle a series of pressure sensors to gauge balance and weight.  More proof
that an extensible Bluetooth-enabled console can be quite effective for
creating entirely novel input devices to the table without kludges.</p>
<p>Look for more posts related to Wii games and other neato things.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, forgot to mention the lil&#39; story of how we got the
high-demand/low-supply system two weeks ago.  We went to Meijer to check
if they potentially had any Wii&#39;s available... and they didn&#39;t really
have any.  However, someone had JUST returned one and a worker was bringing
it back.  Lucky us that someone didn&#39;t want their Wii... for no apparent
reason, since it wasn&#39;t even opened.</p>
