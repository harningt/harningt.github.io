It&#39;s a fairly recent Core2Duo one with Leopard loaded on it.</p>
<p>I have to say that for the longest time, probably since I ever got mutually acquainted with Windows and Mac at school, I&#39;ve never been comfortable about the behavior of Macs.  This, I think, stems from the one-button mouse and it being &quot;different&quot;... Sadly such an odd annoyance blew itself up into unreasonable discomfort w/ Macs... even when a two-button mouse hooked up to one added the &#39;real&#39; right-click behavior expected... and (later on) Linux itself was always different... even to itself...</p>
<p>In the meantime between elementary school and now, I hadn&#39;t had long exposure to Macs except for testing.  I got acquainted with Linux, Solaris, and some other flavors of Unix in my computer science curriculum at Michigan State University, but virtually nothing touched Mac...
As many may know, I got hooked on Linux early in my college years and checked out many of the interesting ways you can manage applications/windows/etc.</p>
<p>Now... onto the MacBook Pro experience....  After taking some time to figure out how all the things worked in OSX at the user-level, things started to make sense to me.  Just like getting used to the differences between Windows and Linux UIs available, the OSX UI had its own peculiarities.  Once I understood/worked-around the differences, work with OSX became significantly more likeable... even preferred many times.</p>
<p>I&#39;d have to say that OSX combines many of the things found in Windows and Linux (though its alot more likely that Windows takes Apple ideas.. but that&#39;s another story) and puts it into an extremely stable/friendly environment.  It has some of the UI and system unity that Windows strives for... and also a fully integrated *nixy environment that makes putting OSS software in extremely easy.  More truthfully, OSX shrinkwraps a custom conglomerate of Open Source Software (ex: Darwin) and oodles of gloss (Aqua + the builtin software suite) into a user-friendly/fault-tolerant system.</p>
<p>In short here&#39;s my view of the different basic systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows - it&#39;s the common machine that must be used in certain situations</li>
<li>Linux - it&#39;s a GREAT high-performance testing ground for neat technologies, server software, and oddly-enough games (often running Windows ones better than &#39;real&#39; windows can)</li>
<li>OSX - the stiff-but-friendly system that keeps software fallout extremely contained</li>
</ul>
