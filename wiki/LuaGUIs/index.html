<h1 id="embed-lua-in-gui-app">Embed Lua in GUI app</h1>
<p>An option that is almost always available it to take a Lua application and design
	it to fit inside of some other language&#39;s GUI framework.</p>
<p>This can be done with callbacks/etc to Lua... as would most GUI frameworks interfacing
	Lua.</p>
<p>The downside is that it is likely to be more of a challenge to use Lua to dynamically
	piece together GUI components.</p>
<h1 id="objective-c-bridge">Objective-C Bridge</h1>
<p>If using Objective-C, one could, for example, use Cocoa to build your user interface,
	through which Lua should have full access to UI components and have a reasonably
	easy time hooking into the framework.</p>
<p>The downside is that the bridge needs TLC and has not been tested much on non-OSX
	varieties (namely, GNUStep).</p>
<h1 id="luagtk">LuaGTK</h1>
<p>This is a nice cross-platform interface to the GTK libraries. Windows, OSX, and Linux
	provide GTK libraries to which this binds.</p>
<p>Previous experience with this has proven problematic, particularly due to the use
	of FFI and problems with x86_64 support. It appears that the library has gone through
	some relatively large changes recently, so I may be in luck.</p>
<h1 id="wxlua">wxLua</h1>
<p>This interfaces with the wxWindows library which provides a common C++ API to various
	&#39;native&#39; underlying toolkits. This can be an option for an application which
	hopes to have a native look... though some things can be problematic, ESP w/ Aqua
	(OSX) GUI behavior/appearance guidelines.</p>
<p>Recently this library broke out into the Lua module mode of operations, allowing
	use of it w/o having to use the &#39;wxLua&#39; executable. I have yet to test this
	kit out.</p>
<h1 id="lua-qt">Lua + Qt</h1>
<p>There appears to be a few attempts at implementing a Qt binding for Lua... not sure
	which is the most complete/stable.</p>
<h1 id="lua-fltk">Lua + FLTK</h1>
<p>There was a binding for Lua 4.0 that was open.. however that is a bit expired.</p>
<p>There has also appeared a recent binding, however that was bundled up in a project
	to which the license/existence was somewhat of a mess...</p>
<p>This sort of option would be nice, as it allows for a uniform lightweight UI for
	many platforms.</p>
<h1 id="others">Others</h1>
<p>.... still looking for others out there... hopefully should have better information
	in the near future, perhaps with useful links...</p></article></div><div id="footer" class="pagefooter"><div id="pageinfo"><span style="font-size: 0.75em"><a rel="license" href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 License" style="border-width:0" width="80px" height="15px" src="/images/cc-by-nc-sa.png"></a><br>Additional permission details at <a xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" href="/wiki/licensing/" rel="cc::morePermissions">licensing</a>.</span></div><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins style="display:inline-block;width:468px;height:60px" data-ad-client="ca-pub-9675050573301887" data-ad-slot="6557091281" class="adsbygoogle"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></body></html>
